        Frontend Developer focused on building responsive, scalable, and
        high-performance web applications using React.js, Next.js, TypeScript,
        and Tailwind CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        I develop reusable UI components, integrate REST APIs, and deliver
        clean, accessible interfaces. I'm comfortable working in Agile teams and
        use tools like Git, Figma, and Jira, while continuously learning and
        optimizing for performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm actively seeking frontend developer roles where I can contribute,
        collaborate with skilled teams, and continue growing as a React
        engineer. Open to remote opportunities.
